Nowadays machine learning has been increasingly used in health care, prediction, diagnosis, 
and as a method of determining priority. Here by using the applicability and performance of 
machine learning methods this model will be used to identify pregnancy complications. The 
dataset used here consists data of from 1014 patients who have consented to share data such as 
age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose levels, body 
temperature, and finally, the model will predict risk levels or complications in the pregnancy and 
will classify the patients with a low, medium or high risk of having pregnancy complications.
In such a scenario, the pregnancy-related risks can be reduced by forecasting the complications 
and by taking preventive measures. Thus, the use of predictive modeling became emergent to 
save the lives of millions of mothers and infant.
